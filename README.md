## Description
Bulls and Cows is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the similar commercially marketed board game Mastermind. Buls and Cows is a simple guess game to find the hidden word which needs to be isogram within max tries. "Cow" means a letter in the wrong position, while "Bull" means a letter in the right position.
